## FAQ
> *Why my Oss! doesn't work?*  

Oss is of course operating on python. It's launched by a new python
launcher "py" which automatically sets used version to be the most accurate.
Older python versions [PEP 397] don't have it installed. In this case simple
python upgrade to newest version should fix the issue.  
  
> *Where is my Oss! installed?*  

It's actually not that easy (I'm working on this) to get into Oss  
installation directory. It's localized in AppData\Roaming in folder  
called Oss.
